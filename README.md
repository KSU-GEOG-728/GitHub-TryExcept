# GitHub-TryExcept
Exercise for GEOG 728 Programming for Geographic Analysis at Kansas State University

### Instructions:

Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment <code>GitHub-TryExcept</code> and clone the new repository as a local personal repository.  Uncompress the provided ZIP file to access the ArcGIS Pro project file in your local repository workspace.  The only file which needs to be pushed to origin at the conclusion of the exercise is a single Python script.  Should you encounter difficulties during the week, seek assistance by posting an issue in GitHub.

### Task:

Edit the provided Python file called <code>GitHub-TryExcept.py</code> to create a stand-alone script that loops through all feature classes in the <code>ExerciseData.gdb</code> geodatabase.  Your script should also accomplish the following objectives and/or include these specific features:

1. Declares only one local variable which should specify as the workspace the <code>ExerciseData.gdb</code> geodatabase.
2. Uses that local variable to set the current workspace environment.
9. Allows script users the ability to supply the workspace value using the Python <code>input()</code> function.
10. Prints (to console) a custom message at the end of the script using Python's <code>format</code> function that includes the name, type, and spatial reference name for each feature class in the user-specified workspace.

## Rubric:

Review the assignment rubric available on Canvas for additional details on how your work will be assessed. Double-check that your script includes a complete header section, uses good commenting, incorporates line spaces between blocks of code, and reads input and writes output to current workspace.

## Submission:

Commit your code changes for <code>GitHub-TryExcept.py</code> to your assignment repository on GitHub.
